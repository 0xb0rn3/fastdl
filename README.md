## 🏗️ Architecture

FastDL uses a hybrid architecture combining the best of both worlds:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Bash Wrapper  │───▶│   Rust Core      │───▶│   File System   │
│   • UI/UX       │    │   • Performance  │    │   • Downloads   │
│   • Config      │    │   • Networking   │    │   • Resume      │
│   • Menus       │    │   • Concurrency  │    │   • Validation  │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

- **Bash Layer**: Provides beautiful UI, configuration management, and system integration
- **Rust Core**: Handles high-performance downloading, networking, and file operations
- **JSON Communication**: Clean interface between layers for maximum flexibility
